<h1><u>FRONTEND TECHNOLOGIES</u></h1>
<h1>1.HTML:</h1>
<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It's the backbone of a website, providing the structure and content that the web browser renders to the user. HTML consists of a series of elements, represented by tags (<>), which wrap around content to define its meaning, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, tables, and more. By using HTML, developers can create web pages that are visually appealing, easy to navigate, and accessible to users.</p>
<h1>2.CSS:</h1>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages. It's used to add visual effects, layout, and styling to HTML content, making web pages more visually appealing and user-friendly. CSS allows developers to separate presentation from structure, enabling them to change the look and feel of a website without modifying the underlying HTML code. With CSS, developers can control colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and more, creating a consistent and engaging user experience across different devices and browsers.</p>
<h1>3.JAVASCRIPT:</h1>
<p>JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic effects to web pages. It allows developers to create responsive, engaging, and interactive web applications by manipulating HTML and CSS elements. JavaScript enables features like animations, scrolling effects, form validation, and real-time updates, making web pages more engaging and user-friendly. It's also used for mobile and web application development, game development, and server-side programming with technologies like Node.js, making it a versatile and widely-used language.</p>
<h1>4.React:</h1>
<p>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed by Facebook, React allows developers to create reusable UI components, making it easier to build and maintain complex web applications. React's virtual DOM ensures fast and efficient rendering of components, while its declarative programming style makes it easy to reason about and debug code.</p>

<h1><u>BACKEND TECHNOLOGIES</u></h1>
<h1>1.JAVA:</h1>
<p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that's platform-independent, allowing Java programs to run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation), Java is known for its robust security features, large community of developers, and extensive libraries and APIs for various tasks. Java is commonly used for Android app development, web development, desktop applications, games development, and machine learning, with popular frameworks and libraries like Spring, Hibernate, and JavaFX.</p>
<h1>2.PYTHON:</h1>
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Developed by Guido van Rossum, Python is widely used for web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Its extensive libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, make it a popular choice for data science and analytics, while frameworks like Django and Flask support web development. Python's ease of use, flexibility, and large community make it a favorite among beginners and experts alike.</p>

<h1><u>DATABASES</u></h1>
<h1>1.SQL:</h1>
<p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language designed for managing and manipulating data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS). SQL allows users to perform various operations, such as creating and modifying database structures, inserting, updating, and deleting data, and querying data to extract specific information. With its simple and intuitive syntax, SQL is widely used for storing, retrieving, and analyzing data in various industries, including business, finance, healthcare, and more, and is a fundamental skill for data analysts, scientists, and professionals.</p>
<h1>2.MongoDB:</h1>
<p>MongoDB is a document database. It stores data in a type of JSON format called BSON. If you are unfamiliar with JSON, check out our JSON tutorial. A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of key value pairs similar to the structure of JSON objects.</p>
